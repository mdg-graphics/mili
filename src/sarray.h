 * A StringArray is an extendable, relocatable, and randomly accessible
 * buffer of arbitrary length strings.  It uses a single contiguous
 * block of dynamically allocated memory.  The memory is mapped as a
 * set of control words followed by an array of offsets into the buffer
 * for each string, then the strings themselves.  The strings are
 * stored in the reverse order of their insertion starting at the high
 * end of the buffer and progressively working lower in memory as the
 * offsets array simultaneously grows from the low end of the buffer into
 * higher memory.  The integer type used for descriptors and offsets
 * determines the maximum addressable buffer size and can be reset from
 * the default (unsigned short) to an appropriate unsigned type prior
 * to compilation.  When a new string is added to a StringArray, it may
 * require a reallocation to extend memory and a subsequent copy operation
 * to push the strings to the top of the newly extended buffer.  Reallocations
 * acquire the smallest whole multiple of the initial StringArray size
 * which will accommodate the string causing the extension to occur.
 * An application should call free() on the StringArray to release its
 * memory when it is no longer needed.
 *
 * All StringArray functions but the string add and sort operations are
 * implemented as macros, and macro interfaces to the string add and sort
 * functions are provided for consistency.
 *
 * The data types and macros of interest to users are:
 *  Types:
 *      StringArray - a string array object.
 *      SAIntType - the integer type (should be unsigned) mapped into
 *          the StringArray buffer to manage its contents.
 *  Macros:
 *      SANEW( sa ) - initialize StringArray sa to a new StringArray of
 *          initial length DEFAULT_SIZE.
 *      SANEWS( sa, size ) - initialize StringArray sa to a new StringArray
 *          of initial length "size".
 *      SASTRING( sa, idx ) - returns pointer to string in StringArray
 *          sa indexed by idx.
 *      SAQTY( sa ) - returns quantity of strings in StringArray sa.
 *      SASORT( sa, a ) - sort the offsets in StringArray sa so that
 *          its strings are referenced in ascending lexicographic order
 *          (if "a" is non-zero) or descending lexicographic order
 *          ("a" is zero).
 *
 * Code example:
 *
 *      #include "sarray.h"
 *
 *      StringArray sa;
 *      int ival, i;
 *
 *      SANEW( sa );
 *
 *      sa_add( &sa, "pea" );
 *      sa_add( &sa, "bean" );
 *      sa_add( &sa, "lentil" );
 *
 *      SASORT( sa, 1 );
 *
 *      printf( "These are members (alphabetized) of the legume family:\n" );
 *      ival = SAQTY( sa );
 *      for ( i = 0; i < ival; i++ )
 *          printf( "%d. %s\n", i + 1, SASTRING( sa, i ) );
 *
 *      free( sa );
 *
 *
 * Function sa_add() returns a non-negative integer
 * on successful completion which is the inserted string's index in
 * the string array.  This index may be used as input to the SASTRING
 * macro to generate a character pointer to the string.  If an error
 * occurs upon string insertion, sa_add() returns a negative integer.
 * The interpretation of the error values is as follows:
 *      OVERSIZED_SARRAY  The new string required an extension which could not
 *                        be performed because the StringArray buffer would
 *                        exceed the maximum addressable length permitted by
 *                        the compiled SAIntType.
 *      ALLOC_FAILED      A reallocation attempt to extend the StringArray
 *                        failed.
 *
 *
 * Map of integers at start of StringArray buffer:
 *
 * 0________|1________|2________|3________|4...____________________________
 * Buffer   |String   |Used     |Initial  |Array of offsets to strings
 * length   |quantity |string   |buffer   |
